# Class-D Amplifier Board

## Overview

This project involves the design of a Class-D amplifier PCB utilizing Texas Instruments' TPA3130D2DAPR 2x15W Class-D amplifier IC. The PCB was designed using Altium Designer 22, based on the schematic provided in Phil's Lab tutorial ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCYNTt5krDM&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Project Highlights

- **2-Layer PCB Design**: Designed a 2-layer board with a dedicated ground reference plane for improved signal integrity and noise reduction.
- **Material Specifications**: Utilized FR4 material with a thickness of 1.6mm.
- **Library Management**: Extracted and refined all component libraries in accordance with datasheet specifications and IPC standards.
- **Design Rule Compliance**: Ensured all design rules were meticulously followed as per IPC guidelines.
- **Manufacturing Outputs**: Generated comprehensive Gerber files and automated assembly files to facilitate seamless manufacturing and assembly processes.
